When the function is returning address type data then it is called return by address. When the function is not returning any values then specify the return type as void. When the function is returning the int value then specify the return type as int i.e. function returning value called return by value. When the function is returning an integer value address then specify the return type as an int* i.e. function returning address called return by address. The basic advantage of return by address is one function related to local data can be accessed from outside of the function.
