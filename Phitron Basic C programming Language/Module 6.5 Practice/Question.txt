 

1. Write a C program that prints all even numbers between 1 and n (inclusive), where n is taken as input.

2. Write a C program that accepts two integers and prints true if either one is 5 or their sum or difference is 5.

3. Write a C program to check whether a given non-negative number is a multiple of 3 or 7, but not both.  For example: inputs 7, 3, 6, 14 should output yes. Inputting 21, 42 should output no.

4. Write a C program that reads an integer between 1 and 12 and print the month of the year in English.  Use switch case.
Input :

5. Input a number between 1 to 12 to get the month name: 8

Expected Output:

August


6. Write a C program that will first read an integer n, then read n integers. From those, it will find the sum of even integers.
Example:

Enter n: 5
Input 5 integers: 2 3 5 6 7

Sum of even integers = 8


7. Write a C program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature state below : 
Temp < 0 then Freezing weather

Temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather

Temp 10-20 then Cold weather

Temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp

Temp 30-40 then Its Hot

Temp >=40 then Its Very Hot


Test Data :

42

Expected Output :

Its very hot.


8. Write a C program to check whether a triangle is Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene. 
Test Data :

50 50 60

Expected Output :

This is an isosceles triangle.

 

9. Write a C program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.

10. Fizzbuzz is a very well known problem. Given a positive integer N, you need to print n lines.
For multiples of 3, you should print Fizz.

For the multiples of 5, you should print Buzz.

For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, print “FizzBuzz”.

        In other cases, print the current line number.

Example

Input: 5

Output:

1

2

Fizz

4

Buzz


11. Write a program in C to display the cube of the number upto given an integer. 
Test Data :

Input number of terms : 5

Expected Output :

Number is : 1 and cube of the 1 is :1

Number is : 2 and cube of the 2 is :8

Number is : 3 and cube of the 3 is :27

Number is : 4 and cube of the 4 is :64

Number is : 5 and cube of the 5 is :125


12. Write a program in C that takes two inputs x and y and prints all numbers that are multiples of x but divisors of y.  If there are none, print no such integers.
Test Data :

5 20

Expected Output :

5 10 20


Test Data :

6 20

Expected Output :

No such integers


13. Write a C program to find all roots of a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). Mention the number of roots and Then list all of them.
Example

Input

Input a: 8

Input b: -4

Input c: -2

Output

There are two roos.

Root1: 0.80

Root2: -0.30


 

14. Write a C program to input sides of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not using if else.
Example

Input

Input first side: 7

Input second side: 10

Input third side: 5

Output

Triangle is valid

 

 

15. Remember the program we wrote to calculate the GPA of a student. Update it so that it can calculate the GPA of multiple terms and finally output the overall CGPA. For simplicity assume that CGPA is the average of all terms GPA.
Example

Input

Enter number of terms: 2


Term 1:

Enter number of Subjects: 3

Enter Marks Subject 1: 80

Grade = A+, Points = 5.00

Enter Marks Subject 2: 70

Grade = A, Points = 4.00

Enter Marks Subject 3: 65

Grade = B, Points = 3.00

Term GPA: 4.00


Term 2:

Enter number of Subjects: 3

Enter Marks Subject 1: 50

Grade = C, Points = 2.00

Enter Marks Subject 2: 70

Grade = A, Points = 4.00

Enter Marks Subject 3: 65

Grade = B, Points = 3.00

Term GPA: 3.00


Overall CGPA = 3.50
