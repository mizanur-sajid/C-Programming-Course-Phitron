The main is an example of user-defined function. Printf and scanf belong to the category of library functions.
We have also used other library functions such as sqrt, cos, strcat, etc.
The main distinction between these two categories is that library functions are not required to be written by
us whereas a user-defined function has to be developed by the user at the time of writing a program.
